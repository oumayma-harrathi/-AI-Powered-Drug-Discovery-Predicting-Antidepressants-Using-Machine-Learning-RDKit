# 🧪 AI-Predicting-Antidepressants  

## 💡 Project Overview  
This project leverages **Machine Learning and RDKit** to predict whether a given molecule can be classified as an **antidepressant**. By extracting key molecular features (such as molecular weight, lipophilicity, and hydrogen bonding properties), a **Random Forest Classifier** is trained to distinguish between known antidepressants and non-antidepressant compounds.

## 🚀 Key Features  
✅ **Real Molecular Data**: Uses **SMILES** representations to process molecular structures.  
✅ **Feature Extraction**: Automatically extracts chemical properties using **RDKit**.  
✅ **Supervised Learning**: Employs a **Binary Classification Model** for prediction.  
✅ **Scalability**: Can be enhanced with **deep learning** (e.g., Graph Neural Networks) for higher accuracy.

## 🔎 Objective  
The goal of this project is to develop an **AI-driven tool** to assist in **early-stage drug discovery**, reducing the time required to identify **potential antidepressant candidates**. By leveraging **machine learning models**, we can streamline the drug development process and improve decision-making in pharmaceutical research.
