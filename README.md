ðŸ’¡ Description:
This project leverages Machine Learning and RDKit to predict whether a given molecule can be classified as an antidepressant. By extracting key molecular features (such as molecular weight, lipophilicity, and hydrogen bonding properties), a Random Forest Classifier is trained to distinguish between known antidepressants and non-antidepressant compounds.

ðŸš€ Key Highlights:
âœ… Uses real molecular structures (SMILES) for prediction.
âœ… Extracts chemical properties automatically using RDKit.
âœ… Employs a Supervised Binary Classification Model to make predictions.
âœ… Can be expanded with deep learning (Graph Neural Networks) for enhanced accuracy.

ðŸ”Ž Goal:
Develop a fast and reliable AI tool to assist in early-stage drug discovery, reducing the time needed to identify potential antidepressant candidates.
